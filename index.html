We are using an api from 4chan, we want to create multiple interactions using that API from 4chan e.g comments etc. 

I am unsure about how to create two promises and use them to create multiple interactions.  

How to optimize our page using JavaScript and make it even more interactive. Malachi went home for fall break, so we were unable to discuss it. According to him he discussed our project with you and explained everything that he wanted to do, however I contacted him and he was unable to link up with me to explain me the project.
